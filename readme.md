# cp-notes
This serves as a repository to store the code I write while learning new algorithms, concepts and others on my journey with [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)

This has two folders:
1. `py` - for my implementations in Python
1. `cpp` - for my implementations in C++



⭐ use this however you want to, and create a PR if you find any bugs / want to suggest improvements
